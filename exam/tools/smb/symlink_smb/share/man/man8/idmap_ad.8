.SH "NAME"
idmap_ad \- Samba\'s idmap_ad Backend for Winbind
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The idmap_ad plugin provides a way for Winbind to read id mappings from an AD server that uses RFC2307/SFU schema extensions\&. This module implements only the "idmap" API, and is READONLY\&. Mappings must be provided in advance by the administrator by adding the posixAccount/posixGroup classes and relative attribute/value pairs to the user and group objects in the AD\&.
.SH "IDMAP OPTIONS"
.PP
range = low \- high
.RS 4
Defines the available matching UID and GID range for which the backend is authoritative\&. Note that the range acts as a filter\&. If specified any UID or GID stored in AD that fall outside the range is ignored and the corresponding map is discarded\&. It is intended as a way to avoid accidental UID/GID overlaps between local and remotely defined IDs\&.
.RE
.PP
schema_mode = <rfc2307 | sfu >
.RS 4
Defines the schema that idmap_ad should use when querying Active Directory regarding user and group information\&. This can be either the RFC2307 schema support included in Windows 2003 R2 or the Service for Unix (SFU) schema\&.

.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
The following example shows how to retrieve idmappings from our principal and and trusted AD domains\&. If trusted domains are present id conflicts must be resolved beforehand, there is no guarantee on the order conflicting mappings would be resolved at this point\&. This example also shows how to leave a small non conflicting range for local id allocation that may be used in internal backends like BUILTIN\&.

The original Samba software and related utilities were created by Andrew Tridgell\&. Samba is now developed by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way the Linux kernel is developed\&.
